## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A requirements ledger, `agent_caps::_requirements`: use cases, principles and
  functional requirements in one module doc, outside semver. `cargo test`
  checks its tables and every `UC<n>` / `FR<n>` cited in a doc comment, and
  fails on a test of the core that cites neither (#13).
- `Catalog::effective(mode)`: every policy with its `Effect` (`On(level)` or
  `Off`) under a mode, and what was degraded, without judging an event. It is
  what `judge` reads, so a platform adapter and a judgment see the same list
  (#6).

### Changed

- Breaking, before 1.0: `Level::Require` is removed, and `Level` is now
  `Inform < Advise < Force`. A guard that stops is `Level::Force`. A level says
  how much the agent is trusted with a rule, not when the check happens: that
  follows from the event the policy judges, and which mechanism of a platform
  stops it is the adapter's (#5).

### Fixed

- `Catalog::accept` now rejects an override that raises a guard to Force when
  the guard lacks a fixture it fails on and one it holds on
  (`AcceptError::RaisedWithoutFixtures`); before, only the level a guard was
  defined with was checked (#11).
